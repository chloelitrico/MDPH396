# Radiomics for Prostate Cancer
## Medical Physics 
### Python Programming

To demonstrate the use of radiomics in extracting features from cone beam computed tomography (CT) images of prostate cancer patients to quantify the amount of gas in the rectum and the probability of the patient experiencing diarrhea following radiotherapy.

Two code files:
1) getHU.py : Uses the region of interest contour points and CT scan to extract the Hounsfield Units found within the region of interest.
2) data_processing.py : calculates statistical values and creates graphical representations of the data
